# zermatt-core JS dependency

When a theme is Zermatt-enabled, npm dependencies get installed. One of them is [zermatt-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zermatt-core).

This is the main JS module that:

- loads modules and their rewrites
- creates the main Zermatt JS object...
- ...and exposes its features
